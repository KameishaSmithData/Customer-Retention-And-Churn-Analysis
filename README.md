ustomer Retention and Churn Analysis ðŸ“Š

Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn trends and identifies strategies to increase retention by converting month-to-month customers into long-term contract users.

Key Findings

âœ… Customers with longer tenure are more likely to retain.
âœ… Month-to-month customers have the highest churn rate.
âœ… Customers on longer contracts purchase more add-ons.
âœ… Offering bundled incentives can encourage contract conversions.
